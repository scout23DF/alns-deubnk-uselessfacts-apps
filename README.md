# Simple Full-Stack WebApp for 'Useless Facts API' Handling

This is a 'Home Task' required during a recruiting process that I attended. 
It consists in a Backend and a Frontend project to simulate the consumption, handling and view of 'Useless Facts' from the external API calls ((https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/random.json?language=en).

For a detailed explanation and usage guide, please refer to the documentation on each project's README.md file:

- Backend : [Quarkus + Kotlin App](./backend/alns-deubnk-uselessfacts-quarkus-kotlin/README.md)
- Frontend: [Angular](./frontends/alns-deubnk-uselessfacts-angular/README.md)
